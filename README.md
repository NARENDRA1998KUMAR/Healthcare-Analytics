In this projectt, i explored the breast cancer dataset and tried to train the model to predict if the person is having breast cancer or not.
We will start off with a weak learner, a decision tree with maximum depth = 2.

We will then build an adaboost ensemble with 50 trees with a step of 3 and compare the performance with the weak learner.
Furthur we will build a logistic regression model an will check the accuracy ,moving on we will do hyperparameter tuning to get the best accurcay in the model.
